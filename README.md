Asteroid attack
-------------------

"Asteroid attack" is a simple 2D computer game created using Python, especially the Python Turtle graphics library which allows drawing. The game is about steering the rocket and shooting down the asteroids flying from every angle. At the same time the player has to avoid collisions with the asteroids. The player begins with 5 lives. They are being lost when the collisions with the asteroids occur. Also, the player is able to gain points by shooting down the small asteroids which appear after shooting down the big ones. Every small asteroid shot down results in +10 points. Shooting a new bullet is possible only when the previous one has crossed the game window lines or has hit any asteroid.

"Asteroid attack" can't be won. The game's aim is to gain as many points as it is possible. When the player loses the last life, the game stops.
